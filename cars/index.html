            <h2 class="card-title">1994 Mazda RX-7 (FD)</h2>
            <p>I've owned this car for over 10 years and during Covid I had started working on restoring and improving the interior as it was going on 30 years old and the damage was adding up.  I started by reupholstering the seats, added a set of gauges for more reliable information about the engine, replaced the shifter and emergency brake boots, and finally replaced the stereo with a modern unit and a custom 3D printed bezel.</p><br/>

            <h5>3D Printed Parts</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Shifter centering collar</b>: I wanted to get a little more fit/finish with the new shifter boot where it meets the knob, so I designed and printed a collar that had a pressure fit in the boot and reduces the slop.</li>
              <li><b>Emergency brake boot bracket</b>: When I removed the emergency brake boot, I found that the plastic piece that holds the boot in place was cracked and needed replacement. Only problem was that I couldn't find anyone that made a replacement or had a used one for sale.  I was able to get a few measurements off the old bracket and reverse engineered a replacement.</li>
              <li><b>Mirror switch retaining clip</b>: Another common failure point was that the mirror switch clips are prone to breaking off.  I got the idea from another creator and modified it for my needs.  A bracket was designed to wrap around the back of the switch, and a large theaded nut to tighten it to the back side of the door panel.</li>
              <li><b>Stereo Bezel</b>: I designed a custom 3D printed bezel to fit the new stereo unit and provide a clean, modern look.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm very fortunate to be able to inherit this car from my dad.  He had bought it back in the 70s and kept it running all these years.  This was the car that I learned to drive stick.  Currently, the car is in serious need to restoration, but unlike the RX-7 which I've been handling as a rolling restoration, I think this one will have to be more in depth.</p><br/>

            <h5>3D Printed Parts</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Visor brackets</b>: Being a Series 1.5, it had the Series 2's visors.  They were old, made of black vinyl, falling apart, and obstructed traffic lights.  I always liked the polycarbonate visors found one cars like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shelby+cobra+sun+visors&udm=2" target="_blank">Cobra</a>, and wanted to see if I could bring that style of visor to the E-Type.  Using the existing bracket arms, I designed a minimalist bracket which mounts a polycarbonate visor to the existing bracket arms.</li>
